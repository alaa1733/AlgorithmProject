# AlgorithmProject
Algorithm Project in python ,using Dijkstra's &amp; Kruskal to see the different and compare the time between them .

First we have a (ProjectDijkstraInBH) file that has a basic interface the user will enter the source number if print wrong that mean the number is 
not in the Graph so I put button show nodes to see the available nodes in the Graph.

Second we have a (dijkstra,Time comparison) it the same implementation of the fisrt file except here we counting the time for each graph.

third, we have a file (Kruskal,Time comparison) which is an implementation of Kruskal and put many graphs to compare the efficiency of this algorithm.

finally ,there is a data.text which contain 3 diffrent graphs to compare the time for each and i did and Excel file to compare between the twe algorithms.
